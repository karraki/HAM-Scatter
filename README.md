# HAM-Scatter
## Halo Abundance Matching with Scatter

This code examines how scatter impacts Halo Abundance Matching techniques. Specifically, it is used to look at the low mass end of galaxy formation to better understand dwarf galaxies.

How to run this code:
`$ python predict.py`

Code requirements:

 - `mcconnachie.dat`
Observational data of Dwarf galaxies from [McConnachie, A. W., 2012, AJ, 144, 4](http://iopscience.iop.org/1538-3881/144/1/4/)
This is not my data and is therefore not distributed within this repository.
The data can be found at: [http://vizier.cfa.harvard.edu/viz-bin/VizieR?-source=J/AJ/144/4](http://vizier.cfa.harvard.edu/viz-bin/VizieR?-source=J/AJ/144/4)
Download the data, name it `mcconnachie.dat`, and place it in the directory you will run the code from.

Code outputs:

- ASCII data file
- PDF multipage plot
